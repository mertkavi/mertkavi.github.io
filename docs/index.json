Introduction # In today\u0026rsquo;s world, nearly every product can be considered a data product. However, the ways in which they use data can vary greatly, with some being more data-intensive than others. This presents new challenges for data-reliant systems, such as ensuring data freshness and providing quick responses to queries. Businesses need to be able to gain insights from this data in a timely manner to stay competitive. Furthermore, domain data has become increasingly complex, with numerous data types like maps, tuples, arrays, and structs.\nThis complexity makes it difficult to gather data through queries due to the growing number of processing stages, time series, graphs, and business logic involved.\nProblem # The system for processing and analyzing data is constantly evolving, and managing it has become increasingly difficult as the amount of data being collected continues to increase. With data platforms and infrastructure advancing at a rapid pace, duplicate components and performance issues have become more common.\nData Flows To address these challenges, scalable data teams need to develop composable components, separate concerns, and create sustainable and reusable APIs.\nProposed System # In recent years, the industry has established several standards for data processing and storage to ensure scalability, resiliency, and efficient querying. These standards include following:\nSeparating storage, compute, and metadata. Storing data on distributed file systems such as HDFS or object storage like MinIO. Using columnar data formats like ORC and Parquet. In addition, multiple query engines like Spark, Presto, and Hive can be used simultaneously to process stored data through metastore/metadata support.\nHowever, timely insights problems require new standards to achieve solutions, including real-time data ingestion with CDC 1 tools like Debezium 2 and real-time stream processing using Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, and others.\nProblem: Language \u0026amp; Dialect # Dialect: Master SQL There are various languages and dialects for data analytics, like SQL, HiveQL, and KSQL 3, and using conventional programming languages via APIs. However, these languages generate disposable components that require rebuilding functions and readable/writable formats and serializers.\nIn addition, many languages and dialects are not usable by other units and departments within an organization. One optimal solution is to use a master SQL interface such as ZetaSQL 4 and connect interfaces and engine layers to compose concepts.\nProblem: Query Efficiency # Efficient querying is also a significant concern for data platforms, as different query engines like Spark, Presto, or Hive use different components, languages, parsers, analyzers, libraries, and distributed executions, leading to overhead and increased latency.\nUsing separate components that can be used collaboratively in other engines or components can decrease latency, maintenance costs, and management costs.\nSolution: Building Common Components # Connecting Layers via Commmon Components To achieve the desired outcomes, it is important to determine which components are exposed and composable to glue common components together. This should be done while following a manifesto and philosophy that addresses the following concerns:\nHaving a single query/compute engine that can be used for interactive, batch, or streaming analytics. Sharing layers and components such as file formats, serializers, and decoders/encoders. Using common, sustainable, deterministic, and easy-to-use APIs that can be used to interact with other services or units. Joint: Query/Compute Engine # The processing of data can be approached from various perspectives, and there are three types of engine novel data stacks available, namely batch, interactive, and streaming engines.\nBatch Engine # Batch data pipelines typically run on a scheduled basis, such as hourly, daily, or monthly, and utilize available computing resources within the designated pool. These pipelines are not generally designed for sophisticated, real-time processing, but rather for efficiency in terms of resource and time-space requirements.\nThe proposed system design includes batch query engines, as well as other types of engines, that can utilize the same pool of computing resources as an end-to-end layer. This extends beyond just high-level CPU and memory pools, such as those provided by Kubernetes or Mesos 5 resource schedulers. For example, if the data stack utilizes Presto for interactive engine processing, the same SQL query can be executed on the batch engine without requiring any modifications.\nInteractive Engine # Interactive data pipelines or sessions require sub-second query performance, without data copying, and utilize in-memory for data access.\nETL jobs can be run on the interactive engine if they are efficient, but otherwise can be executed on the batch engine. If the data stack employs Spark as the batch engine, the same SQL query can be run on the interactive engine without any modifications. Additionally, all query engines within the stack share a common metastore.\nStreaming Engine # Streaming executions involve distinct concepts that differ from batch and interactive engines, including:\nIngestion techniques from the source, such as checkpointing 6. Processing techniques, such as late or watermark-based processing 7. At-least-once or exactly-once sink methods and semantics 8, as well as the synchronization of metastore partitions. Challenges related to schema evolution 9. These concepts present significant challenges that require careful resolution. Despite these differences, streaming engines share many common components, such as a front-end SQL parser and analyzer, code generation, and coordination and execution layers.\nJoint: Storage # Modern data organizations are composed of several teams, including data scientists, data analysts, data engineers, and machine learning engineers, among others. There are various methods for accessing data, as mentioned in the post. When there is a single interface for accessing data through a Query/Compute Engine Joint, there must be one file or data representation for interacting with storage.\nAn emerging trend in data processing is the use of machine learning, which involves utilizing wider tables with thousands of columns for feature representation and working with higher-dimensional data 10. Another trend enables the seamless file finalization of real-time streaming output. Therefore, the file format used must be capable of supporting these types of data processing.\nJoint: Execution Engine # The most performance-critical component of a data stack is the execution engine, which contains hundreds of computational functions, such as string and numerical operations 11, that handle all processing tasks.\nTypically, each query engine (batch, interactive, or streaming) has its own execution engine or layer, which utilizes several programming languages, such as Java or Scala, and various fault-tolerant mechanisms.\nThe proposed system design features a single execution engine that is integrable by design for every engine, including batch, interactive, and streaming. This design reduces redundant tasks, eliminates code duplication, and improves performance, while also enabling easy adoption of emerging data processing methods, such as machine learning operations. An example of this philosophy can be seen in Velox 12.\nConclusion # Data platforms are constantly evolving and changing, especially with the introduction of artificial intelligence innovations. The following features are essential for a modern data stack:\nComposability between engines and layers. Wide-area caching for each engine and layer. Minimal components in engines and layers. Wide-reaching and sustainable APIs. Minimal code proof. High efficiency and performance with low overhead through strong coordination. Support for machine learning operations by design. Low management and maintenance costs and ease of operation. As technology advances, data stacks will become more refined and sophisticated.\nChange Data Capture\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDebezium\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nksqlDB Overview\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nZetaSQL - Analyzer Framework for SQL\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nApache Mesos\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSpark Streaming Programming Guide\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nStructured Streaming Programming Guide\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nExactly-Once Semantics Are Possible: Hereâ€™s How Kafka Does It\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSchema Evolution and Compatibility\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFeature (machine learning)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\npresto/StringFunctions.java\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHello from Velox\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"9 April 2023","permalink":"/building-common-components-in-data-lakehouse-is-a-necessity/","section":"Writings","summary":"Disclaimer: Any opinions expressed are solely my own.

Introduction # In brief, Kubernetes is a platform for automating and allocating containers that includes built-in features for healing, scheduling, and deployment practices (such as rollouts and rollbacks), as well as load-balancing and auto-scaling capabilities. Containers are abstracted by the name \u0026ldquo;Pod\u0026rdquo; within Kubernetes.\nKubernetes architecture # Problem # Nowadays, numerous industries face the challenge of collecting and integrating data to solve complex problems. These data-centric problems span from customer service to process automation, and as the number of problems increases, so does the volume of data that needs to be processed. Consequently, the information technology industry is expected to deliver robust, reliable, and scalable data and machine learning solutions more than ever before, to meet the demands of the rapidly growing data volumes.\nProposed System # Almost all data-intensive applications require either batch or real-time data processing. These applications include analytics reports, machine learning tasks, and real-time advertising campaign actions, all of which process large volumes of collected data.\nFor several years, Hadoop has been the preferred choice for batch data processing, and it has primarily used YARN for resource management. However, with the emergence of containerization, Mesos has become a popular resource manager for Hadoop environments. In contrast, real-time processing has always been more complex than batch processing and requires different concepts such as watermarks.\nData applications involve significant computation tasks that must handle large amounts of data at scale. Consequently, these applications require distributed systems and task orchestrations to manage computation devices, processes, threads, containers, pods, or other resources.\nSchedulers are crucial for managing data workloads, whether it is a simple data processing job or a multi-component machine-learning operation flow. Machine learning models typically require an API server, while API servers require load balancing and other microservices concepts.\nFinally, cloud flexibility is a critical consideration for data applications as they must be capable of running on different platforms such as private, public, or hybrid cloud. Data is a valuable asset for companies and governments, and as regulations increase, the importance of data management and processing is only likely to grow. The data race has just begun.\nConclusion # Managing these types of problems and systems can be complex, but Kubernetes has emerged as a solution with several competitive advantages, including:\nResource efficiency: Kubernetes optimizes the use of computing resources and ensures that containers are efficiently allocated to nodes. Seamless scalability on containers or nodes: Kubernetes allows for seamless scaling of containers or nodes based on the needs of the application. Built-in scheduler: Kubernetes has a built-in scheduler that automates the deployment and scaling of containers and manages the allocation of computing resources. Cloud flexibility: Kubernetes provides the flexibility to run applications on different cloud platforms, including private, public, and hybrid clouds. Pushing to apply engineering best practices: Kubernetes encourages the use of best practices in software engineering, such as containerization, microservices, and continuous integration and delivery, to improve the reliability and scalability of applications.
